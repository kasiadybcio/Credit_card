# Credit card churn prediction

## Introduction to the project

 The business manager, that is taking care of consumer credit card portfolio, is concerned about the increasing number of customers leaving their credit card services. To address this issue, the manager wishes to proactively identify customers at risk of churning (becoming attrited). The dataset includes information on 10,000 customers with features such as age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, and credit card category among others. The primary objective is to analyze this dataset to find patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition. By leveraging this information, the manager aims to develop a predictive model that can identify customers likely to discontinue their services. The goal is to enable the bank to intervene with these customers, offering improved services to potentially reverse their decisions and mitigate customer churn.
